## Hello World!! 👋 This is Veda Bommareddy
###### 🚀 Data Engineer | ETL/ELT + Real-time data pipelines | AWS | Snowflake | dbt| Kafka |

I love turning messy raw data into crisp dashboards, reliable pipelines, and “aha!” business insights.
Think of me as the person who makes data go from 🗂️ chaos → 📊 clarity → ⚡ speed.

🛠️ Tech Toolbox
Programming & Processing: Python 🐍, SQL, PySpark, SparkSQL, Kafka
Data Platforms & Orchestration: Snowflake ❄️, dbt, Dagster, Airbyte, Hadoop/Hive, Great Expectations
Cloud & Infra: AWS (Lambda, Glue, EC2, ECS, EKS, S3, Redshift, Athena, DynamoDB, RDS), Terraform, Docker 🐳, GitHub Actions
Analytics & Governance: Data Modeling (Star/Snowflake) 🌟, ETL/ELT, Data Lineage, Grafana 📈, Data Quality, OLTP/OLAP


🎯 What I’m Up To
📚 Self-learning from scratch, building projects step by step, and sharing the journey
Designing deep-dive dbt projects (because SQL + YAML = ❤️)
Trying to make dashboards so fast that analysts think I bribed Snowflake
🔍 In search of making sense of everything — from data pipelines to life itself 😅


🌱 Fun Facts
🏎️ Believe data pipelines should run smoother than F1 pit stops
📕 Fuelled by books + curiosity
